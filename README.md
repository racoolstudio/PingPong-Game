# Ping Pong Game

## Overview

Ping Pong is a classic two-player arcade game where each player controls a paddle, and the objective is to bounce a ball back and forth between the paddles. The game continues until one player misses the ball. The game speed increases as players score points, making it more challenging as time goes on.

## How to Play

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

3. Install Dependencies: This game uses the `turtle` module, which is a part of Python's standard library. No additional installation is required.

4. Run the Game: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

   ```
   python ping_pong_game.py
   ```

5. Game Controls:
   - Player 1 (Right Paddle):
     - Move Up: Press the 'Up' arrow key.
     - Move Down: Press the 'Down' arrow key.
   - Player 2 (Left Paddle):
     - Move Up: Press 'w' or 'W' key.
     - Move Down: Press 's' or 'S' key.

6. Gameplay: The game will start automatically after running the script. Each player must try to bounce the ball off their paddle to prevent it from crossing their side of the screen. The game will speed up as players score points, making it more challenging over time.

7. Scoring: Each time the ball passes the opponent's paddle, the player scores a point.

8. Winning the Game: The game continues until one player reaches a pre-determined number of points (e.g., 5). The player who first reaches this score wins the game.

9. Restart: After the game ends, you can restart it by running the script again.
